# Open Twi
This is an effort to bring Twi (wrongly known as Akan) to a standard freely accessible to everyone to learn and contribute. 
Current focus is on Asanti Twi (Asante Twi or Ashanti Twi) but it not restricted to it. Everyone is welcomed to contribute 
and help shape the future of this project.
