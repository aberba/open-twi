Below is a list of I am currently working on;

* [elementary OS Twi translation](https://github.com/aberba/elementaryOS-twi-guide): elementary OS is open source and freely available to use. Translating it to Twi will make it easilty accessible to a small minority if Ghanaians who can only read or understand the language. Especially people close to me.
* https://github.com/laberba/twi-translation-guide : A guide for Twi translation
* https://github.com/laberba/twi-synonyms: A list of words in  twi for the purpse of creating a complete twi dictionary
